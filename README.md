# Cat-dog-classification-
A deep learning project for classifying images of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
This project demonstrates a machine learning approach to classify images as either a cat or a dog. It leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a labeled dataset of cat and dog images.

The goal is to achieve high accuracy by preprocessing images, augmenting data, and fine-tuning a deep learning model.
